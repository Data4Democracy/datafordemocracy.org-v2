project_descriptions: 
  - Classifying, tagging, analyzing and visualizing news events about internal displacement. Based on a challenge from the <a href="https://unite.un.org/ideas/content/idetect">IDMC</a>. Our aim is to build a tool that can populate a database with displacement events which can be both classified by a machine and verified by a human. The details of each event are to be fed into a tool for analysis and visualization.
