    <h2>Inclusiveness Policy</h2>
      <p>No sexism, racism, discrimination or any kind of exclusion will be tolerated in association with the Data For Democracy Hackathon (D4DH) and we reserve the right to refuse and/or remove content based on our principles. We encourage inclusive and welcoming environments in all our locations. We encourage a free and open activity where creativity should know no censorship and we hope all participants will exercise their creative freedoms. We take pride in our hackers, organizers, and community but Data For Democracy is not liable for anyone's specific views and opinions.</p>
    <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The D4DH focuses on bringing communities together through collaboration, innovation, and experimentation and our website engages that spirit. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, appearance, ethnicity, national origin, citizenship, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).</p>
	<p>This code of conduct outlines our guidelines for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite all those who participate in D4DH to help us maintain these guidelines and create safe and positive experiences for everyone. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, please let us know through our D4DH <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqmnUikug9owDEtxjUW\fxdKF_sWc4C9K2uCbkqkypLBzEsw/viewform">Feedback Form</a>!</p>
      <h3>Appropriate Behavior</h3>
        <p>We wish for D4DH participants to exercise consideration and respect in their speech and actions, attempt collaboration before conflict, and refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. We also expect the same consideration and respect to be applied to projects and content created during D4D events.</p>
       <p>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders and site organizers immediately if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</p>
     <h3>Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
       <p>Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our site locations or online community, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.</p>
       <p>Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, appearance, ethnicity, national origin, citizenship, socioeconomic status, or religion; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
     <h3>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
       <p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.</p>
       <p>If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, local D4DH organizers may take action top stop the unacceptable behavior, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).</p>
     <h3>If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
       <p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify your local or regional D4DH organizer as soon as possible or submit a notice through the D4DH <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqmnUikug9owDEtxjUW\fxdKF_sWc4C9K2uCbkqkypLBzEsw/viewform">Feedback Form</a>!</p>
     <h3>Addressing Grievances</h3>
       <p>If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify your local or regional D4DH organizer with a concise description of your grievance.</p>
     <h3>Scope</h3>
       <p>We wish for all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all D4DH venues—online and in-person—as well as in all one-on-one or group communications pertaining to community business.</p>
     <h3>Onsite Locations</h3>
       <p>Be respectful to the donated spaces. Return the rooms to how you found them before you leave.</p>
     <h3>Modification</h3>
       <p>Data for Democracy reserves the right to change, modify or make exceptions to all policies at will.</p>
